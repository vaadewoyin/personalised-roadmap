## Overview

This repository serves as a structured roadmap for my deep learning and MLOps journey. It includes a collection of curated resources, courses, books, tutorials, and projects designed to guide and track my progress in these fields.

## Learning Path

### Deep Learning Courses
- **[Introduction to Deep Learning by Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2021/dl-course.html)**: 170 Video Lectures from Adaptive Linear Neurons to Zero-shot Classification with Transformers (in Pytorch)
- **[Full Stack Deep Learning (FSDL) 2021 and 2022 by UC Berkeley](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/)**: A hands-on course covering the full lifecycle of deep learning projects.

### MLOps
- **[MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp)**: A practical course focused on real-world MLOps practices.
- **[Serverless Mlops](https://www.serverless-ml.org/modules)** : Serverless Mlops course
- **[MLOps Foundations iNeuron Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmQAMKHKeLZ9iaLWBULDE_hiPtOiHiDz0)** : MLops Foundations playlist (Around 32hrs)
- **[ML observability course by Evidently Ai](https://learn.evidentlyai.com/)** : Free Open-source ML observability course for data scientists and ML engineers by Evidently AI.

### Data Engineering
- **[Data Engineering UC Berkeley, Fall 2022](https://fa22.data101.org/)**: This course covers the Data Science lifecycle, relational models, SQL, data preparation and cleaning, NoSQL.
- **[Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)**: A comprehensive course on building data engineering pipelines.

### Software Engineering
- **[Beyond Jupyter by TransferLab](https://transferlab.ai/trainings/beyond-jupyter/)**: Focus on software design for ML applications, advocating structured, object-oriented design.
