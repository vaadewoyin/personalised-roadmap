# Overview

This repository serves as a structured roadmap for my deep learning, MLOps, and AI journey. It includes a collection of curated resources, courses, books, tutorials, and projects designed to guide and track my progress in these fields.

## Learning Path

### Deep Learning Courses
- **[Introduction to Deep Learning by Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2021/dl-course.html)**: 170 Video Lectures from Adaptive Linear Neurons to Zero-shot Classification with Transformers (in PyTorch).
- **[Full Stack Deep Learning (FSDL) 2021 and 2022 by UC Berkeley](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/)**: A hands-on course covering the full lifecycle of deep learning projects.

### MLOps
- **[MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp)**: A practical course focused on real-world MLOps practices.
- **[Serverless MLOps](https://www.serverless-ml.org/modules)**: Serverless MLOps course.
    - #### Serverless MLOps Project Showcase
      [Some of the Serverless ML Systems developed by students in the Scalable ML and Deep Learning master's level course (ID2223) at KTH University](https://id2223kth.github.io/assignments/2024/ID2223Projects2024.html).
- **[MLOps Foundations by iNeuron Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmQAMKHKeLZ9iaLWBULDE_hiPtOiHiDz0)**: MLOps Foundations playlist (around 32 hours).
- **[ML Observability Course by Evidently AI](https://learn.evidentlyai.com/)**: Free open-source ML observability course for data scientists and ML engineers by Evidently AI.
- **[The Full Stack 7-Steps MLOps Framework by Paul Iusztin](https://pauliusztin.medium.com)**: Learn MLE & MLOps for free by building, deploying, and monitoring an end-to-end ML batch system. This intermediate to advanced course targets MLEs and SWEs transitioning to MLEs. The course includes source code, reading, and video materials on Medium.

### Data Engineering
- **[Data Engineering UC Berkeley, Fall 2022](https://fa22.data101.org/)**: This course covers the Data Science lifecycle, relational models, SQL, data preparation and cleaning, and NoSQL.
- **[Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)**: A comprehensive course on building data engineering pipelines.

### Software Design for Machine Learning Applications
- **[Beyond Jupyter by TransferLab](https://transferlab.ai/trainings/beyond-jupyter/)**: Focus on software design for ML applications, advocating structured, object-oriented design. Topics include Object-Oriented Programming, Guiding Principles, Refactoring Journeys, and Anti-Patterns.

### Generative AI
- **[Generative AI for Beginners by Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/)**: This course covers the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with 18 comprehensive lessons. Topics include text generation, chat applications, search applications, image generation, and more.

### Specialized LLM Courses
- **[Full Stack LLM Bootcamp](https://thefullstack.com/llm-bootcamp)**: A two-day program covering prompt engineering, LLMOps, UX for language interfaces, augmented LLMs, and rapid deployment of LLM-powered apps. Originally an in-person bootcamp, now available with recorded lectures.

- **[LLM Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp)**: A 10-week online course focused on building Q&A systems using LLMs and RAG. Covers topics like LLM orchestration, monitoring, best practices, and hands-on projects.


## Books
- **[Dead Simple Python by Jason C. McDonald](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/dead-simple-python/9781098156671/f07.xhtml)**: A practical guide to Python programming focusing on simplicity and clarity.

## Miscellaneous
